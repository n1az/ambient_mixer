        <h3 class="about">My current status is "Undergraduate Student" under CSSE program in American International University-Bangladesh.Hard working,passionate and artistic mind with great interest on various research domain including AI, QIP, Quantum computation and more.I use linux as my daily driver. I prefer minimal and clean world.So I made this application where I can wash away my distraction by playing some high definition ambient natural sound and play with gravity points sometimes through the free time from my other goals.I have done a course named Human Computer Interaction where I have found some design and life principle which is driving me more positively everyday. Hope you are enjoying this PhySci world, have a peaceful and happy time!</h3>
